I am an actuarial scientist trained in Mexico with several years of experience in the public and private sector conducting cost-effectiveness studies. Currently I hold a positon as a biostatistician at the Toronto Western Lupus Clinic under the supervision of Dr. [Zahi Touma](https://www.uhnresearch.ca/researcher/zahi-touma). 

In recent years I've gained interest in bayesian methods which nowadays have become more popular given the advances in computing resources and algorithms. Because of this my disseration explores the use of Bayesian methods for modeling in the context of Health Technology Assessment.
